# React Portfolio Redux

  [live site](https://github.com/noodle77)

  ## Description
  This project serves as an upgraded replacement for my previous dev portfolio in the form of an SPA powered by React and Vite. Through programming this application, I learned how to write and style React components as well as how to use React router.
